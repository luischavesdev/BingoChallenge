# Bingo Challenge
<p align="justify">
  Bingo implementation done for the GameMath coding challenge. Consists on a simple console application that generates a bingo card, and grants the player access to basic inputs like revealing balls, and 
  choosing whether or not to buy extra balls.

## Build/Run Instructions
<p align="justify">
  Being a C++ project, you can either choose to build it yourself, or just run the precompiled Linux binary <code>App</code> (compiled with clang in Ubuntu 24), under the respective folder. If you want to build the project, run the appropriate script under 
  <code>BuildScripts</code>, and then open the VS solution if you're in Windows, or run the Makefile in Linux. Just bear in mind that since the project uses <code>dlopen()</code> to interface with the dynamic 
  library, building the solution is as far as you'll go under Windows. I guess supporting Windows is something to consider under future work.
